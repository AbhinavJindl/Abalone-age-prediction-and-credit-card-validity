----------------HOw TO RUN--------------

PARt1:

python3 abalone.py

In order to run the desired part change the inst value in first line of main
1 for createing parameter matrix acc to gender
2 for creating the dataset parametric matrix
4 for getting weights for desired lamda and f (change their value if you want to run for your choice)
7 for part 6 to 9 (all graphs will be shown one by one) (change values for desired fraction, lambda etc in first few line of the 7 block)


PART2:

python3 credit.py
In order to run the desired part change the inst value in first line of main
1 for plotting dataset
2 for comaparing accuracy of gradient and newton
4 for higher degree polynomial (for changing degree change degree of polynomial in create_dataset(x,degree))



In order to achieve the same results dont recreate the pickle files

-------------requirements---------

python3
matplotlib
